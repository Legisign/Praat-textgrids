  2020-03-27  1.4.0.dev1    Tier + Tier -> Tier, as it should be.
  2020-03-29  1.4.0.dev2    Tier.to_csv() fix, changes in dev1 still need
                            testing.
  2020-03-29  1.4.0.dev3    For tier + tier to work, tier.xmin and tier.xmax
                            should be read after all. Parser changes as well
                            as fixes for Tier.__add__().
  2020-04-05  1.4.0.dev4    Fixes in Interval.__init__() and
                            TextGrid.tier_from_csv().

  2020-04-06  1.4.0.dev6    Trying to set Interval.xmin and Interval.xmax
